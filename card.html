						<p>Happy Birthday, sweet Hailey!</p>
						<br>
						<p>I love you so much and am so proud of you. I've watched you pour your heart and soul into everything at Johns Hopkins this year, and I couldn't be more impressed by all you've accomplished. Your determination is extraordinary, and it's inspiring to see you do so well.</p>
						<br>
						<p>But it's who you are that truly amazes me. You have an incredible gift for making me feel loved and cared for. Every moment with you is a reminder of what kindness looks like. Whether it's a simple check-in or the way you remember the little things that matter most, you never fail to brighten my day.</p>
						<br>
						<p>I'm reminded constantly how lucky I am to have you in my life. You encourage me, you uplift me, and care for me. I love you more every day, and I could not wish for a better girlfriend, partner, and friend.</p>
						<br>
						<p>I hope that you feel every bit as loved as you make me feel each and every day. Here's to an amazing year ahead and countless new memoriesâ€”together.</p>
						<br>
						<p>Happy Birthday!</p>
						<br>
						<p>Love,<br>Dylan</p>
